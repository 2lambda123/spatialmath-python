Spatial Maths for Python
========================


This package provides Python classes and functions to represent, print, plot,
manipulate and covert between many common representations of position,
orientation and pose of objects in 2D or 3D space. This includes
mathematical objects such as rotation matrices :math:`\mat{R} \in \SO{2},
\SO{3}`, angle sequences, exponential coordinates, homogeneous transformation matrices :math:`\mat{T} \in \SE{2}, \SE{3}`,
unit quaternions :math:`\q \in \mathrm{S}^3`, and twists :math:`S \in \se{2},
\se{3}`.
